# Terminal-based-Quiz-application
This terminal-based quiz application, built using C programming, tests and enhances users' 
knowledge of data structures and algorithms through an engaging interface. Users enter their name, 
select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard), and answer 10 randomized multiple-choice 
questions, earning +20 points for correct answers and -5 for incorrect ones, with no penalty for 
skipping. The application dynamically loads questions from text files and features a live leaderboard 
that updates scores after each session, fostering competition. Core programming concepts like file 
handling, structs, arrays, and sorting are utilized for efficiency and scalability. Unique features include 
the ability to skip questions and an easily expandable question bank, ensuring variety for repeated 
plays. It is designed to be a practical learning tool for students and educators, while also demonstrating 
the power of C in creating interactive systems. Future enhancements, such as a timer for added 
pressure and a multiplayer mode for real-time competition, aim to make the experience even more 
immersive and challenging.
